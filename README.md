# TurnBasedWarGame

I want to make a war game with simple graphics so that it can be played on low end devices. Turns will start with a planning phase and then an action phase where you will see your orders play out. I want it to have many authentic mechanics. It will have local (single-device) multiplayer before online/multi-device and will be designed for computer browsers first.
